- Implemented proper lifecycle management (start/stop camera)
- Added app lifecycle observer to handle background/foreground transitions

### ‚úÖ **2. Enhanced Permission Handling**
- Improved camera permission checking
- Added permission dialog with retry functionality
- Better error messages for permission issues

### ‚úÖ **3. Better Scanning State Management**
- Visual indicators for scanning status (Ready/Processing/Paused)
- Color-coded scanning frame (Green=Ready, Orange=Processing, Red=Paused)
- Proper re-enabling of scanning after processing

### ‚úÖ **4. Improved User Feedback**
- Enhanced loading states with progress indicators
- Better error messages with retry options
- "Add Product" shortcut for unknown barcodes
- Network error handling with retry functionality

## üîç **Troubleshooting Steps**

If barcode scanning is still not working, try these steps:

### **Step 1: Check Console Output**
When you try to scan, look for these debug messages in the console:
```
üîß Initializing scanner...
üîç Checking camera permission...
‚úÖ Camera permission granted
‚úÖ Scanner initialized successfully
üì∑ Camera resumed
=== SCANNER DEBUG ===
Barcode detected: 1 barcodes
Raw barcode value: 1234567890
üîç Handling scanned code: 1234567890
```

### **Step 2: Check Camera Permission**
- **Android**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Camera (Enable)
- **iOS**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Your App (Enable)

### **Step 3: Test Camera Access**
- Try using your device's built-in camera app to ensure camera hardware works
- Check if other barcode scanning apps work on your device

### **Step 4: Check Physical Environment**
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Hold device steady and at appropriate distance from barcode
- Make sure barcode is clear and not damaged
- Try scanning different types of barcodes (QR codes, UPC codes, etc.)

### **Step 5: Check Network Connection**
- Scanner needs internet to look up products in database
- Check if your device has active internet connection
- Try scanning a known barcode that exists in your product database

## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: Black Screen Instead of Camera**
**Possible Causes:**
- Camera permission not granted
- Another app is using the camera
- Camera hardware issue

**Solutions:**
- Force close the app and reopen
- Restart your device
- Check camera permissions in device settings
- Try the permission dialog "Retry" button

### **Issue: Camera Shows But Nothing Happens When Scanning**
**Possible Causes:**
- Scanner state is stuck in "loading" or "paused" mode
- Network connectivity issues
- Server not responding

**Solutions:**
- Look for the status indicator at top of scanner (should show "Ready to scan")
- If stuck in "Processing...", wait a few seconds or restart the app
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the server is running

### **Issue: "Product Not Found" for Valid Barcodes**
**Possible Causes:**
- Product doesn't exist in database
- Network issues preventing API calls
- Server connection problems

**Solutions:**
- Use the "Add Product" button to create the product
- Check if server is running and accessible
- Verify the barcode format matches what's in your database

### **Issue: Scanner Works But App Crashes**
**Possible Causes:**
- Memory issues
- Conflicting camera usage
- App lifecycle problems

**Solutions:**
- Close other camera-using apps
- Restart the app
- Restart your device
- Clear app cache/data

## üìã **Diagnostic Checklist**

Before reporting issues, please verify:

- [ ] Camera permission is granted
- [ ] Device camera works in other apps
- [ ] Internet connection is active
- [ ] Server is running and accessible
- [ ] Console shows scanner initialization messages
- [ ] Status indicator shows "Ready to scan"
- [ ] Good lighting conditions for scanning
- [ ] Barcode is clear and undamaged

## üîÑ **Testing the Enhanced Scanner**

The enhanced scanner now provides:

1. **Visual Status Feedback**: 
   - Green frame = Ready to scan
   - Orange frame = Processing barcode
   - Red frame = Scanning paused

2. **Status Messages**:
   - "Ready to scan" = Camera active and waiting
   - "Processing..." = Barcode detected, looking up product
   - "Scanning paused" = Temporarily disabled

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Network errors show retry button
   - Unknown barcodes show "Add Product" option
   - Permission issues show helpful dialog

4. **Improved Performance**:
   - Prevents duplicate scans within 3 seconds
   - Proper camera lifecycle management
   - Memory-efficient controller usage

## üí° **Tips for Better Scanning**

- Hold device steady and parallel to barcode
- Ensure barcode fills most of the scanning frame
- Use good lighting (avoid shadows or glare)
- Keep barcode flat and undamaged
- Wait for "Ready to scan" status before scanning
- If scanning fails, try moving closer or further away

**If issues persist after trying these steps, please provide:**
1. Console output when attempting to scan
2. Device model and OS version
3. Lighting conditions and barcode type
4. Whether camera works in other apps
5. Network connectivity status
